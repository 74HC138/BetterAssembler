# Better Assembler

or short **BASM**

BASM is a lua based multi architecture macro assembler capable of executing lua code included in the source files to make code more readable, simple and flexible.
Example use cases would be data tables for function like sin(x) or similar but also to automatically generate data based on other files like rom filesystems.

Currently **BASM** is not yet finished and will take a while to complete.
